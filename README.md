# mediCare
This is a web-based application. Here I use Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL in this application.
This application has 3 types of users are here. Such as general user(Who can search for medicine and watch medicine details), admin(Who can apply CRUD operation on user and medicine), and head of the admin(who can manage CRUD operation on admins).
